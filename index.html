                The inspiration behind the "Simple Banking System" project stemmed from a desire to create a user-friendly and accessible platform for managing personal finances. As a team, we recognized the importance of efficient banking services and wanted to develop a solution that would simplify banking processes for individuals.

                The project timeline began with extensive brainstorming and conceptualization, where we outlined the key features and functionalities we wanted to include. We conducted research to understand user requirements and analyzed existing banking systems to identify areas for improvement.

                The development phase started with building the backend infrastructure, including database design, API development, and implementing security measures to ensure data protection. We utilized Flask, a Python web framework, for rapid development and flexibility.

                Once the backend was in place, we moved on to the frontend development, focusing on creating an intuitive user interface that would provide a seamless experience for users. We leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the various screens and interactive elements.

                Throughout the development process, we followed an agile approach, regularly testing and iterating on our work. We addressed bugs, enhanced functionalities, and incorporated user feedback to refine the system.
